# Using MWF with ASP.NET Web Forms

Since __Mobile Web Framework (MWF)__ is platform-agnostic, the framework
can be consumed within any environment (PHP, raw HTML, Coldfusion, etc.). This also
includes __ASP.NET Web Forms__. 

However, a lot of the functionality within the ASP.NET Web Forms framework is enabled by placing
Server Controls within a `form` element. Unfortunately, this can cause issues
with MWF's default styling, which expects that only standard form entities will be included within
the `form` element.

This repository contains two major components:

* A set of __override styles__ to correct these styling issues
* __Guidelines__ for restructuring ASP.NET Web Forms pages to avoid these issues

## Override Styles

### Including the Stylesheets

To apply the override styles, you need to create a directory underneath the `mwf/root/assets/css`
directory that includes the three stylesheets (for example `aspnetoverride`) and then reference this
directory in the `mwf/config/css.ini` configuration file:

```
custom[]="aspnetoverride"
```

Alternatively, you could include the stylesheets
[via the CSS handler](https://github.com/ucla/mwf/wiki/API%3A-Script%3A-CSS-Handler):

```
<link rel="stylesheet" href="http://{MOBILE_DOMAIN}/assets/css.php?basic={PATH_TO_BASIC.CSS}&standard={PATH_TO_STANDARD.CSS}&full={PATH_TO_FULL.CSS}" type="text/css">
```

### Applying the Styles

Next, simply add the `.webform` class to the ASP.NET form containing
the web page's elements. For forms within this containing form, use a `div` element with an
`.inner-form` class instead of a form.

For example, imagine we have the following standard MWF page with a form:

```html
<h1 id="header">
	<a href="/"><img src="/img/logo.png" alt="Home" /></a>
	<span>Web Forms Example Page</span>
</h1>
          
<form>
	<label>
		<span>Name</span>
		<input type="text" name="name-input" required="required" placeholder="Input Name" />
		<span class="invalid">Name value was invalid</span>
	</label>
</form>
```

Now, imagine this page was wrapped in a form element. To force the styling to match the default
MWF styling, add `.webform` to the containing `form` element and switch the inner `form` with
a `div` with the `.inner-form` class.

```html
<form id="mainForm" runat="server" class="webform">

	<h1 id="header">
		<a href="/"><img src="/img/logo.png" alt="Home" /></a>
		<span>Web Forms Example Page</span>
	</h1>
          
	<div class="inner-form">
		<label>
			<span>Name</span>
			<input type="text" name="name-input" required="required" placeholder="Input Name" />
			<span class="invalid">Name value was invalid</span>
		</label>
	</div>

</form>
```

## Guidelines

The following guidelines provide some general advice for avoiding the issues described above:

### Restrict Form Scope

Many of the Server Controls do not actually require a wrapping `form` element. For example,
the controls that do not require user state, including `Label`, `Image`,
and `Hyperlink`, can exist outside of a form.

### Don't Include a Wrapping Form on the MasterPage

As noted above, since many Server Controls do not require a wrapping `form` element, not
including this `form` element on a MasterPage will allow consumers of the MasterPage to
only use a containing `form` when necessary.

### Don't Use Unnecessary Server Controls

Although ASP.NET Web Forms development encourages the use of Server Controls, they are not
always necessary. For example, the following:

```html
<asp:HyperLink Text="About Me" NavigateUrl="~/About.aspx" runat="server"></asp:HyperLink>
```

Could easily be replaced with:

```html
<a href="~/About.aspx" runat="server">About Me</a>
```

Furthermore, if application URL resolving is unnecessary, this could be further reduced to:

```html
<a href="About.aspx">About Me</a>
```
